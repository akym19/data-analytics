# MySQL Journey

In this repository, I coded along and learned with Alex The Analyst's MySQL Tutorial.

## This enables me to learn SQL skills such as: 

### Beginner

Creating database and tables, SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY and ORDER BY, HAVING vs WHERE, and LIMIT and ALIASING

### Intermediate

Joining tables, UNIONS, STRING FUNCTIONS, CASE STATEMENTS, different SUBQUERIES, and different WINDOW FUNCTIONS

### Advanced

CTEs, Temporary Tables, Stored Procedures, Triggers and Events
